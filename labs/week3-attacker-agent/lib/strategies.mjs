// strategies.mjs — the attacker's playbook. Each entry is ONE attack family the students already met in
// Week 2 Day 4, expressed as: an opening message, a few follow-ups to ESCALATE with if the opener is
// refused, and the GOAL (which canary/flag proves it worked). The escalation ladder is what makes this an
// *agent* and not a static suite: when MerciBank refuses the obvious ask, the agent tries a harder framing
// (and, if you give it an attacker model, it writes its own — see lib/llm.mjs).
//
// families group strategies for the UCB planner (lib/planner.mjs) — explore/exploit is chosen per family.
