// report.mjs — assemble two audience-specific reports from CONFIRMED findings. Code owns the FACTS (repro,
// evidence, AIVSS, OWASP, the fix pattern); the report brain (brains.writeReport) only rewrites the prose if a
// model is set. Two audiences, deliberately different: the DEVELOPER report says exactly what to change in
// code; the STAKEHOLDER report says what it means for the business and how bad it is.
