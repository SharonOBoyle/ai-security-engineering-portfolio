// catalog.mjs — the attacker's playbook. A STRATEGY binds an objective to an orchestrator and a converter
// chain, with seed messages and an escalation hint. The curated DEFAULT set (below) is what runs in class —
// broad enough to prove every objective and show every orchestrator, small enough to finish on time. The
// generated MATRIX (generate()) crosses objectives × converters × orchestrators for a `--all` deep sweep —
// that is the "big, big set of attacks" without shipping a payload dump: breadth comes from composition.
//
// family groups strategies for the bandit planner (lib/planner.mjs) — explore/exploit is chosen per family.
